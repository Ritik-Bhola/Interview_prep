1. A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following:
The Bourne Shell
The C Shell
The Korn Shell
The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.
Shell scripts and functions are both interpreted. This means they are not compiled.

2. How to determine Shell => echo $SHELL

3. Shell Comments --
You can put your comments in your script as follows −
#!/bin/bash

# Script follows here:
pwd
ls

Save the above content and make the script executable −
$chmod +x test.sh

The shell script is now ready to be executed −
$./test.sh

Note − To execute a program available in the current directory, use ./program_name

4. Variable Names --
The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _).

Defining Variables --
variable_name=variable_value

Accessing Values --
To access the value stored in a variable, prefix its name with the dollar sign ($) −

For example, the following script will access the value of defined variable NAME and print it on STDOUT −
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Ritik"
echo $NAME

Read-only Variables --
Shell provides a way to mark variables as read-only by using the read-only command. After a variable is marked read-only, its value cannot be changed.

For example, the following script generates an error while trying to change the value of NAME −

#!/bin/sh

NAME="Ritik"
readonly NAME
NAME="xyz"

The above script will generate the following result −
/bin/sh: NAME: This variable is read only.

Unsetting Variables --
Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks. Once you unset a variable, you cannot access the stored value in the variable.
unset variable_name

The above command unsets the value of a defined variable. Here is a simple example that demonstrates how the command works −
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Ritik"
unset NAME
echo $NAME

The above example does not print anything. You cannot use the unset command to unset variables that are marked readonly.
