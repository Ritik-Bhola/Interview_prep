Linux Basics 

1. What is the use of echo command? 

The echo command in Linux is used to display a line of text or string on the terminal. It's commonly used for: 

Displaying simple text. 

Outputting the value of shell variables. 

Writing text into files using redirection. 

Examples: 

Display a message:
 
echo Hello, World! 
 

This prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal. 

Display the value of a variable: 

 

 

MY_VAR="Linux Basics" 
echo $MY_VAR 
 

This prints the value of MY_VAR, which is "Linux Basics". 

Write text to a file: 

 

 

echo "This is a new line" > example.txt 
 

This writes "This is a new line" to example.txt.
